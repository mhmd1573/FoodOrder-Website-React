Foodera is a website that focuses on providing users with a seamless shopping experience for their grocery needs. Although the design may not be the main focus of this project, I put in a lot of effort to ensure that the shopping cart code and functionality are top-notch. Through this project, I learned a lot about:

The importance of having a clear plan before starting to code, especially when dealing with complex systems like shopping carts.

Writing clean, modular, and maintainable code, which helped me make changes to the website's functionality without breaking other parts of the codebase.

Debugging and troubleshooting common issues that arise when building web applications.

Overall, I'm happy with what I've accomplished with Foodera, and I'm excited to continue learning and improving my skills as a web developer. Feel free to browse the codebase and provide feedback or suggestions on how I can make it better.
